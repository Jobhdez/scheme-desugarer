# manifold-scheme: a scheme to c compiler

a scheme to c compiler: development in progress

## Acknowledgements
1. The articles (about compilers) and an actual compiler in Scheme by Dr. Might were very helpful.

2. I also would like to acknowledge [Robert Smith](https://github.com/stylewarning) because he gave me intuition for how continuation passing style conversion worked.

3. The 90 minute Scheme to C [compiler](https://gist.github.com/nyuichi/1116686) and [slides](http://churchturing.org/y/90-min-scc.pdf) by Dr. Feeley, the creator of Gambit Scheme, helped a lot.
